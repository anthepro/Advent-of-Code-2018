# Advent of Code 2018
Yet another edition... I probably won't be solving AoC problems on a daily basis this year, so you might just have to wait for the weekend to see my solutions. Let's go!
UPDATE: Day 22... c'mon! I know coming up with new problems isn't that easy, but this just feels too repetitive and not really creative and challenging. I'm giving up.
